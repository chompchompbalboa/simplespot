# Simplespot

A central host to serve multiple websites - and a work-in-progress platform to quickly redesign an existing website.

Built in PHP, using Laravel, the back end serves up base templates for React.js containers and otherwise functions as an API for the front end, handling requests for site properties and authentication, among other things.

The front end is built using React, with state handled using a customized Flux architecture.
